# AIRBNB HOTEL BOOKING ANALYSIS

**VOIS AICTE Internship - DIY Project 4**

## Project Overview
Analysis of Airbnb dataset to understand market dynamics and pricing patterns in the hospitality industry.

## Research Questions
1. What are the different property types in the Dataset?
2. Which neighbourhood group has the highest number of listings?
3. Which neighbourhood group has the highest average prices for Airbnb listings?
4. Is there a relationship between the construction year of property and price?
5. Who are the top 10 hosts by calculated host listing count?
6. Are hosts with verified identities more likely to receive positive reviews?
7. Is there a correlation between the price of a listing and its service fee?
8. What is the average review rate for listings, and does it vary based on neighbourhood group and room type?
9. Are hosts with a higher calculated host listings count more likely to maintain higher availability throughout the year?
